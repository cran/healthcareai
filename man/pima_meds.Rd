  \item{patient_id}{Unique identifier, used to join \code{pima_diabetes}}

\description{
This is a companion dataset for \code{\link{pima_diabetes}}. The
\code{pima_diabetes} dataset is real; this dataset is synthetic. You can see
how it was generated here:
\url{https://docs.healthcare.ai/articles/site_only/best_levels.html#appendix-data-generation}.
Briefly, each patient in \code{pima_diabetes} is assigned 0-4 medications
from the following six: insulin and metformin are more common among
diabetics, prednisone and metoprolol are less common among diabetics, and
nexium and tiotropium are equally likely among diabetic and non-diabetic
patients. Each patient-medication has a \code{years_taken} value associated
with it, which is a random number drawn from an exponential distribution.
